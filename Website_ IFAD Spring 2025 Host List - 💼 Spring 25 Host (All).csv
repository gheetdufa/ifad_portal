It’s a vital mission: Healthy and profitable American agriculture provides food and clothing for countless people worldwide and is a key pillar of our economy.

Millions of people benefit from APHIS’ programs and services every day. As our name suggests, APHIS’ work centers around animal and plant health, but our programs also address animal welfare, biotechnology, wildlife damage management, and global trade. Although APHIS may not be a household name, our efforts are seen and felt both far and wide. From ensuring an abundant and affordable food supply, safeguarding air travel against wildlife-related accidents, and sheltering household pets from harm during a disaster, to protecting the trees in our forests and communities, APHIS’ work touches people’s lives in a multitude of ways.

APHIS’ strong commitment to serving the American people guides all that we do. With an eye toward excellence and value, we’re constantly finding new ways to accomplish our work so that APHIS’ way of doing business reflects the way agriculture and commerce operate today. We are using more technology to allow industry to move at the speed of commerce and keep up with demand for agricultural commodities. We are developing better, faster processes and streamlining operations to improve our customers’ experience and deliver services more effectively. And, we are increasingly looking to innovative, nonregulatory solutions to achieve our aims—making sure agriculture stays healthy while ensuring the swift flow of trade. These actions—and many others—are saving both time and money as APHIS strives to better serve its stakeholders and the American public.

Within APHIS, Emergency and Regulatory Compliance Services (ERCS) focuses all issues related to emergency preparedness and response, regulatory investigative and enforcement activities, safety initiatives, and the regulation of agricultural select agents in one APHIS program. ERCS’ services-delivery structure bridges science with the need for long-range planning, policy oversight and cooperative stakeholder engagement.

Within ERCS, Investigative and Enforcement Services (IES) is responsible for planning and implementing an integrated investigative and enforcement program which serves as an integral part of the Agency’s overall regulatory program for protecting American agriculture. IES directs and coordinates investigations related to the laws and regulations pertaining to APHIS’s programs, through fact finding, civil and criminal investigations, and investigations with other federal, state, and local regulatory or law enforcement agencies (including USDA’s Office of the Inspector General).
IES also administers other types of enforcement actions (e.g., official warnings, stipulations, and
formal administrative proceedings), collaborating with USDA’s Office of the General Counsel
(OGC) as needed. IES’ primary customers are APHIS’s programs, including Animal Care (AC),
Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), and
Veterinary Services (VS), and the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border
Protection (CBP).","As an Investigation and Compliance Specialist in the Plant Health and Border Protection Enforcement Branch, I am responsible for the review and analysis of IES’ investigated cases related to animal and plant health programs to determine legal sufficiency; determination of appropriate
enforcement actions and preparation of cases for potential criminal or administrative hearings;
work with OGC; and issuance of official warnings, stipulations, and regulatory enforcement
correspondence. I work collaboratively with an “Enforcement team” that includes a Compliance Case Examiner, Case Examiners, Enforcement Specialists, other Compliance Investigation Specialists, and a Supervisory Investigation and Compliance Specialist and coordinates the review and evaluation of IES’ policies, procedures, and Reports of Investigation (ROIs) to ensure compliance with prevailing requirements; promote national uniformity, and enhance the quality and integrity of IES’ products and services; serve as a technical authority for animal and plant health laws in my respective practice area; and coordinate nonprocurement suspension and debarment actions that may be initiated as a result of criminal convictions or prior administrative decisions.
APHIS is also an emergency response agency. This means that I may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments away from my assigned duty station to support emergency programs that respond to national emergencies, such as wildfires and animal disease outbreaks.

These courts review a trial courts (District or Circuit Court) actions and decisions in given cases and decide whether the trial judge properly followed the law and legal precedent. Circuit Court Circuit Courts generally handles more serious criminal cases, major civil cases, including juvenile and other family law cases such as divorce, custody and child support and most cases appealed from the District Court, orphans courts and certain administrative agencies. Circuit courts also hear domestic violence cases. Each County and the City of Baltimore has a circuit court. Cases may involve juries or sometimes are heard by a judge only. District Court Most people experience the court system through the District Court. Cases heard here include motor vehicle (traffic) and boating violations and other misdemeanors and specified felonies, domestic violence and peace order petitions, landlord-tenant disputes, small claims and other civil cases involving limited dollar amounts, and replevin (recovery of wrongfully taken or detained goods). Each county and the City of Baltimore has at least one District Court location. A case in the District Court is argued before a judge only: there are no jury trials in District Court. Orphans Court The Orphans Court is a specialized court that handles wills, estates, and other probate matters and limited aspects of guardianship. Other Bodies in Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings The Office of Administrative Hearings listens to contested executive branch administrative law cases, except for those concerning officials or agencies exempted by law. Federal Courts in Maryland Federal courts are authorized by the U.S. Constitution to deal with issues involving laws enacted by Congress, as contrasted with state courts, which apply the laws of their state and local governments. For more information, see the U.S. Courts' website.

Commission on Judicial Disabilities serves the public in a variety of ways. Its primary function is to receive, investigate and hear complaints against members of the Maryland Judiciary. It also supplies judicial nominating commissions with confidential information concerning reprimands to or pending charges against those judges seeking nomination to other judicial offices. Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure meets regularly to consider proposed amendments and additions to the Maryland Rules of Procedure and submits recommendations for change to the Supreme Court of Maryland.

In-person,2,"Education, NonProfit and Social Services","Collegiate Directions, Inc.","Director, Scholars Program",https://collegiatedirections.org/,"Since 2005, Collegiate Directions, Inc. has worked to reduce the achievement and opportunity gap for first-generation-to-college students from low-income households with a series of programs designed to help them maximize their potential and ensure they are equipped with the academic, financial, and social-emotional tools necessary to successfully graduate from college and prepare for the world of work. Ours is a high-touch model that begins in 10th grade when Scholars are assigned a CDI counselor who initiates a series of wraparound services that include study skills workshops, test preparation, college application assistance, development of tailored college lists, financial aid application support, and ongoing assistance and leadership throughout college. CDI’s wellness counseling is offered to every high school student enrolled in the Scholars Program to help them address and work through a range of personal issues. Our career mentorship program provides a deep, ongoing impact that focuses on career coaching and access to workforce opportunities through experiential learning. With more than 450 students having participated in our Scholars Program and thousands more reached by our School Support program in which we share our best practices to help equip high school college counselors with the knowledge necessary to get their students on the path to a degree, CDI has developed a model for student success that defies conventional wisdom and outpaces national averages. According to the Pell Institute, only 16-percent of low-income, first-generation-to-college students graduate from college within six years. For CDI Scholars in this same demographic, 89-percent graduate from college. Beyond preparing our Scholars for the academic rigor of college, CDI emphasizes the importance of developing them as well-rounded, responsible, productive citizens. Each year CDI Scholars develop and implement a service project to lend their support to those in need. In one such project, Scholars raised more than $2,000 and secured miscellaneous supplies to assist students at a school in Sierra Leone. Because CDI enters the lives of our Scholars at a period of transition from high school to college and follows them through college, helping them move onto their career paths, we know the challenges they face in the best of times, and how personal issues can make their journey even more difficult. As a result, CDI invests significant time, effort, and energy into the mental health and well-being of our Scholars. In recent years we have expanded our mental health offerings and staff to permit each Scholar more time to meet one-on-one with a wellness counselor. The results CDI achieves are the result of a strategy cultivated over the past 15 years that rests on the bedrock principle that potential cannot turn into opportunity without support, and without support, opportunity cannot turn into success. At CDI, support is infused into everything we do and is the common thread that allows us to produce remarkable results. Scholars and their families are supported by CDI which is supported by generous individual donors and forward-thinking organizations whose support has allowed for the expansion of our core offerings beyond the classroom. Even in the face of new challenges CDI’s critical work continues as we collectively embrace our Scholars and move forward together, toward a brighter, more hopeful tomorrow where they can achieve all that is possible.","A student can expect to learn and experience the following: - Workshops for High School Students focused on financial literacy or college application related content - Observe student engagement in workshops, one-on-one sessions. - Learn about the distinct services provided at the organization including the wellness services provided by licensed social workers, career mentoring support provided by the organization and volunteer mentors, and the outreach the organization does Overall, an intern will gain knowledge in supporting first-generation students through key aspects of their college journey.",4827 Rugby Avenue Suite 001,"Bethesda, MD 20814",Yes,No,No,No,Tues,Yes,No,
